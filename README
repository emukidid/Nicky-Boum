About:
------
Nicky Boum is a classic platformer game initially designed for the Amiga. The
game was published by Microids in 1992 and was also ported to the Atari ST and
PC EGA platforms.

This project aims to rewrite the original engine of the game and requires the
original datafiles.

This rewrite is based on the reversing of the Amiga and PC versions.

The engine initially designed for Nicky Boum was re-used, along with several
modifications in 2 games also distributed by Microids : Nicky 2 (1993) and
Carlos (1994). Currently, only Nicky Boum and Nicky 2 are playable with this
project.


Requirements:
-------------
You need the original DOS version data files, easily found by searching for "Nicky Boom PC DOS" or "Nicky 2 PC DOS".
The list is :
	*.BLK (Nicky Boum)
	*.CDG (Nicky Boum)
	*.REF (Nicky Boum)
	*.SPR (Nicky Boum)
	*.SQX (Nicky 2)

A GameCube with a GameCube controller running Swiss + SD card adaptor.


Usage:
------------------------
Download the release and extract it to the root of your SD Card. Copy the files obtained above and put them in the
/apps/nicky/nicky1 or /apps/nicky/nicky2 directory. If the PC DOS release you've obtained has directories, just flatten
everything into one dir.

By default the DOL will try to load Nicky 1 from /apps/nicky/nicky1, if you use Swiss you'll get prompted in
Swiss which game to load which will be either /apps/nicky/nicky1 or /apps/nicky/nicky2.

The game keys are :
	D-PAD/Analog   move Nicky
	A              jump
	B              action button
	X              toggle inventory display
	Start          pause the game
	L Trigger      cheat mode, gives you all bonuses
	R Trigger      cheat mode, jumps to the next level
	Z              Quit back to title


Notes:
------------------------
If someone wants to do a Wii version via a PR then please, by all means. I've also steered away from SDL slightly and
it would be better if it went completely native, but this works enough for my own use that I didn't bother.

There's some SDL GL code that I couldn't get working, I'm not sure if it's ever worked even on PC.
